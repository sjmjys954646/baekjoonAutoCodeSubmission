### 문제 설명

<p>Superbowl Sunday is nearly here. In order to pass the time waiting for the half-time commercials and wardrobe malfunctions, the local hackers have organized a betting pool on the game. Members place their bets on the sum of the two final scores, or on the absolute difference between the two scores.</p>

<p>Given the winning numbers for each type of bet, can you deduce the final scores?</p>

### 입력 

 <p>The first line of input contains n, the number of test cases. n lines follow, each representing a test case. Each test case gives s and d, non-negative integers representing the sum and (absolute) difference between the two final scores.</p>

### 출력 

 <p>For each test case, output a line giving the two final scores, largest first. If there are no such scores, output a line containing "impossible". Recall that football scores are always non-negative integers.</p>
